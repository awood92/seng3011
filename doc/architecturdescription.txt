The architecture diagram above illustrates the premliminary coponents of the system that we are developing, and the interactions between them. As can be seen, market data will be parsed by the market simulator, which will generate the orders. The market simulator will then forward the orders to the engine, which will maintain the order book and simulate the matching of orders in order to create trades. The same orders will also be forwarded onto the Strategy from the market simulator. The strategy may then generate its own algorithmically generated orders and also send them to the engine. The engine will forward all matched trades to the Strategy Evaluator, which will then analyse and process the trades generating a report that outlines the performance of the given strategy within the market conditions of the provided sirca data.
